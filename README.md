# smile-detector-app
<h1>Face detection App</h1>
<p>This is a face detetcion app which was completely build using haar algorithm and openCV library in python.</p>
<h2>Lets see the steps and procedure to this app (How it works?):</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Opening webcam or taking an image/video to the python file</li>
  <li>Convert them from color images or frames to grayscale images so that the AI can detect the Images very clearly</li>
  <li>Applying haar algorithm ("Haarcascade.xml" file present in the same directory) to detect the face in the image or frame</li>
  <li>Grab the coordinates of the face, I used "for loop" to grab more than one face at a time.</li>
  <li>Release/Exit the code when the user type "Q" as the output</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the brief procedure of This face-detection-app. If you have any queries, then contact me through <a href="https://twitter.com/mahendra_4919">twitter</a></p>
